## Overview

This project is a website designed to explain key JavaScript concepts such as asynchronous programming, callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop.
## Concepts Covered

- **JavaScript Async**: Introduction to asynchronous programming in JavaScript and its importance in handling long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.
  
- **Callback**: Explanation of callback functions and how they are used to handle asynchronous tasks.

- **Promise**: A guide to working with promises, a more modern approach to managing asynchronous code in JavaScript, with examples of `.then()` and `.catch()`.

- **Async/Await**: Explanation of the `async` and `await` keywords for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous, simplifying promise-based logic.

- **Event Loop**: An overview of the JavaScript event loop, explaining how it manages the execution of asynchronous code through the call stack and message queue.
